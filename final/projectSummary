I plan to write a program that models the orbit of Mercury around the sun, specifically its perihelion precession. This program will account for the gravitational effects due to the other planets and the relativistic effects that cause the perihelion to shift by 574 arcseconds per century. The program will model the calculated precession versus observational data to assess the accuracy of the predicted orbit from Newton's Law of Gravitation and of that value plus the two modifications mentioned above.
The program will be written in Matlab and accept an input that specifies a time interval. It will output the total precession of the orbit and an animated three-dimensional plot of the orbit. I'd also like to write a program that models the orbit of an arbitrary planet and star system from user inputs of the planet mass, star mass, orbit radius, and eccentricity.
