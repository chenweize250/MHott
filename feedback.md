Problem 3

There's a lot going on in the plots. I appreciate the extra touches. Though, I think that the extra touches have backfired in the python script. I'm getting a very confusing plots with many lines in there. Take another look at that.

Problem 4

Both scripts look good, very efficient use of MATLAB in the script.

I looked again at problem 3 python script and I'm still getting some odd output :(, Let's look at this tomorrow.

Problem 5 

Looks great, the graphs appear correct. One little nitpick is the labels on the axes - it's probably good to keep them as short as possible.
