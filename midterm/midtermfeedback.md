# Midterm
## Function
Simple, gets the job done, and you did incorporate the choice of units in a simple way SI/AU instead of defining the unit for each quantity, which was unnecessary.
## Script
Looks great, nice method in answering the 4th questions (though there is a simpler method using categorical data). The only thing to watch out for is in line 5 - the hardcoded 1988. It wasn't really necessary, and always try to avoid hardcoding. But other than that, like I said, looks great.
